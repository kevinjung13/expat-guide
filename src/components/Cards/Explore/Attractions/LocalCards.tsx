          description={`On-water markets selling produce, and souvenirs from boats floating on canals. 
          Such markets are a traditional way of life and have been operating for hundreds of years.
          One of the best floating markets for me is: Khlong Bang Luang in Thonburi. 
          Unlike other floating markets, Khlong Bang Luang mainly attracts locals.
          Located on a picturesque canal lined with old wooden houses, art galleries, and cafÃ©s.`}
