# Farang

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## `Introduction`

Hello and Welcome! This is my Bangkok Expat Guide called Farang. I started building this guide while working on `Oasis Marketplace`. 

The idea behind this project came out of a desire to build a guide for both exisiting and newly relocated expats.

During this time, a fellow developer (with whom I am working with on `Oasis Marketplace` with) informed me about `Float UI` and how they provide numerous templates and components without any costs. He also suggested me to learn how to use `Storybook` and `Tailwind CSS`, which I found were excellent tools to design and build responsive, as well as customized components. At this point, I had learnt how to code for 6-7 months.

## `Tools`

The tools used for this project are: TypeScript, Next JS, Float UI and Tailwind CSS. Storybook was NOT used for this project, as I felt I need to learn more about it.
